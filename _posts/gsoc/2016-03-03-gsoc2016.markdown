guideline3: You are free to come up with your own ideas. The ideas should be about Internet of Things (IOT), Embedded Systems, Computer Security and 'Wireless Adhoc and Sensor Networksâ€™. Also if you love to work on any of these subjects but do not have an idea you can always contact us.
guideline4:	Lets Talk! The best way to solve problems that you might have is to contact our mentors and also our community.  This will help you to not get bogged down in your ideas and to move on.
