title:  OpenDF - Rewrite the frontend using React or Polymer
description: <p>Front-end of the OpenDF is currently done using AngularJS, but we see we need a framework which is extra good in component based UIs. We like to make use of HTML5’s Web Components APIs in OpenDF. We are flexible on what framework to use, it could be React or Polymer or any other web component based framework.</p><p>This also should go with ES6 and SCSS or LESS. Gulp or Grunt should be used for development, once the new release is ready for the production, files should be precompiled( ES6 and SCSS or LESS ), merged, minified, versioned,  and put into ‘dist’ folder. Then the NGINX server can serve the new release.

requiredknowledge: Any Web Components framework, ES6 and Babel, SCSS or LESS, npm/yarn, Gulp/Grunt
