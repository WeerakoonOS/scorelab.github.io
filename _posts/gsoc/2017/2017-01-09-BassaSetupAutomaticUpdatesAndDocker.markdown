title:  Bassa - Setup, Automatic Updates and Docker
description: <p>When running Bassa for the first time, it should redirect to the setting up process, where the admin accounts are created, organization details and logos set. Other details like, file storage directories, DB settings, auto update checking period, etc also could be configured there.</p><p>Automatic Updates is where when we push a new release tag on Github, running Bassa instances should prompt to install the new version. If the user (admin user) accepts to install the new version, then the new version should get installed seamlessly.<p>Finally, Dockerize Bassa to let anyone simply run Bassa by running the Docker, which starts the databases, web servers, etc.</p>
